### Explanation:

- **`main.dart`:**
   - Entry point of the application.

- **`app/`:**
   - Contains all application-specific logic.

- **`app/screens/`:**
   - Contains individual screens of the application.
   - Each screen represents a specific UI component of the app.

- **`app/widgets/`:**
   - Reusable UI components/widgets used across multiple screens.

- **`app/models/`:**
   - Data models representing entities in the application.
   - Models are used to structure and manage data within the app.

- **`app/providers/`:**
   - Riverpod providers for managing the application state.
   - Provides data to different parts of the application.

- **`app/services/`:**
   - Services for handling external operations such as network requests, database interactions, etc.
   - Encapsulates functionality related to specific services.

- **`app/main_app.dart`:**
   - Initializes the application, sets up Riverpod providers, and defines MaterialApp.

- **`theme/`:**
   - Contains files related to the theme of the application.
   - Defines the visual appearance of the app.

- **`utils/`:**
   - Contains utility/helper functions and constants used throughout the application.
   - Encapsulates commonly used functionalities and constants.

### Usage:

- **Screens:** Add new screens under `app/screens/` directory. Each screen should be a separate Dart file representing a specific UI component.

- **Widgets:** Create reusable UI components under `app/widgets/` directory. These components can be shared and reused across multiple screens.

- **Models:** Define data models under `app/models/` directory. These models represent entities within the application and help manage data.

- **Providers:** Implement Riverpod providers under `app/providers/` directory. These providers manage the application state and provide data to different parts of the application.

- **Services:** Develop external services under `app/services/` directory. These services handle operations such as authentication, data fetching, etc., and encapsulate related functionality.

- **Main App:** Configure the main application setup in `app/main_app.dart`. Set up Riverpod providers, define MaterialApp, and initialize the app.

- **Theme:** Define the visual theme of the application in `theme/app_theme.dart`. Customize colors, typography, and other visual aspects of the app.

- **Utilities:** Create utility/helper functions and constants in `utils/` directory. These utilities encapsulate commonly used functionalities and constants used throughout the application.
